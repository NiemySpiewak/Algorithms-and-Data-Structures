# Algorithms and Data Structures ðŸ§ ðŸ“š
This repository contains assignments from the Algorithms and Data Structures course. Each assignment focuses on implementing key algorithms and data structures, with an emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical application.

To ensure correctness, unit tests are provided for each task. These tests help verify that the implementations meet the expected requirements and handle edge cases properly.
# ðŸ“‚ Assignments
1: Merge Sort on Linked Lists
2: Finding the k-th Largest Element in a Sliding Windows
3: Counting Dominated Points
4: DFS to traverse a graph represented as an adjacency list
5: Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes
6: Dijkstra's Algorithm with Double-Step Modification
7: The program uses Dynamic Programming to determine the maximum number of rooms reachable from each cell in a grid, considering movement constraints.
8: The program uses Dynamic Programming to align two sequences (X and Y) with the minimum cost, filling a 2D table L and computing the optimal alignment.
